Classify genes by age, assess quality of classifications, visualize results

Initial Steps
=============

 1. Acquire focal species protein sequences

 1. Acquire outgroup protein sequences

 1. Umasked blastp all focal species proteins against all outgroup sequences

 1. Stratify into age groups by absolute e-value threshold

Additional Steps
================

 1. Build species distance tree for all represented species
